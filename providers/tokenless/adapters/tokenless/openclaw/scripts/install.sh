#
# Responsibility boundary (mirrors sec-core/openclaw-plugin/scripts/deploy.sh):
#   - This script ONLY deploys an already-built plugin.
#   - Compilation (index.ts -> dist/index.js) is the Makefile's job:
#       make -C providers/tokenless build-openclaw-plugin
#     which `make install` runs automatically before `install-adapter-resources`
#     copies the result into $SHARE_DIR/openclaw.
#   - If dist/index.js is missing, exit with a clear error pointing at the
#     Makefile target. Do NOT compile here — adapters shouldn't invoke npm at
#     deploy time.
