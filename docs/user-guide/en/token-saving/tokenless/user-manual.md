# Tokenless User Manual

[中文版](../../../zh/token-saving/tokenless/user-manual.md)

Tokenless is designed for tool-heavy AI agents. Its CLI compacts schemas and JSON responses, while its adapters can also rewrite shell commands, check tool dependencies, and pass compressed results to an agent. The exact effect depends on the host framework: some adapters replace the original result, while others add compressed context without removing the original.

Start with the [Quick Start](QUICKSTART.md) if this is your first use.

## Build the standalone CLI from source

Source builds are intended for development and debugging. The project currently validates and supports source builds on Linux only:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alibaba/anolisa.git
cd anolisa/providers/tokenless
cargo build --release --locked -p tokenless-cli
./target/release/tokenless --version
```

This path produces only the standalone `tokenless` CLI. It does not install `rtk` or the agent integration resources. To use the complete feature set in an agent, install through the anolisa CLI as described in the [Quick Start](QUICKSTART.md).

## Build the Python SDK from source

CPython applications can use Tokenless in process instead of starting the CLI for every lifecycle
operation:

```bash
make python-wheel
python3 -m venv /tmp/tokenless-python
/tmp/tokenless-python/bin/pip install target/wheels/anolisa_tokenless-*.whl
```

The build requires a discoverable CPython 3.11+ development environment. The wheel uses the
CPython 3.11 stable ABI and remains specific to the operating system and architecture for which it
was built.

The Python SDK has two layers. The `anolisa-tokenless` package exposes the framework-neutral
`TokenlessSdk`, direct `TokenlessRuntime` operations, and typed `TokenlessStats` queries. The
same-version `anolisa-tokenless-agentscope` package maps that generic lifecycle to AgentScope. See
the [Python SDK guide](sdk.md) for both layers, runnable examples, and configuration.

## Capabilities and boundaries

| Capability | Behavior implemented in the current code | Important boundary |
|------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Schema compression | Removes `title` and `examples`, removes fenced and inline code from descriptions, collapses whitespace, and truncates descriptions | Runs on the cosh/Cosh-NG `BeforeModel` hook and per OpenCode tool definition (Qwen Code's manifest entry is skipped by current hosts); other users can call the CLI |
| Content-aware response compression | Routes JSON records, build logs, and long plain text through matching compressors, then accepts only a smaller end-to-end result | Direct `compress-response` remains JSON-only; host capabilities decide whether shared hooks can replace with text and publish retrieval |
| TOON encoding | Encodes JSON and keeps the JSON input when the estimated token count does not decrease | Replaces the original when the host accepts text replacement; hosts without replacement capability pass through |
| Command rewriting | Calls `rtk rewrite` and submits the rewritten shell input when a rule is available | The command actually sent to the shell changes; unsupported or denied rewrites pass through |
| Tool Ready | Legacy pre-call checks for declared binaries, versions, configuration, permissions, and optional dependencies | Hard-disabled; it cannot inspect, repair, or block tool execution |
| Stash | Stores content removed by string, array, depth, or schema-description truncation and by build/log gap removal | One-hour TTL and 10,000 live entries by default; other removed fields are not stashed |

The implementation contains no fixed saving-rate guarantee. Results depend on the payload, adapter delivery semantics, and the share of the model context that came from tool data. Measure your own workload as described in [Measuring savings](measuring-savings.md).

## How Tokenless participates in a tool call

After an adapter is enabled, a tool call may pass through these stages:

```text
Before the tool: hard-disabled Tool Ready hook → command rewrite
After the tool: content detection → eligible compressors → optional Stash/TOON → statistics
Before the model: schema compression
```

This is a capability map, not a pipeline that every framework runs. For example, the content-aware
protocol path currently serves Cosh-NG, Qoder, supported Claude Code releases, and OpenCode;
OpenClaw, Hermes, and DeepSeek Harness retain dedicated JSON response paths. Codex and Qwen Code do
not replace post-tool output under their current host contracts. See
[Agent integration](framework-integration.md).

## Behaviors to understand

### Installation does not enable every adapter

`anolisa install tokenless` installs the component and its adapter resources. To make an agent use Tokenless automatically, also run:

```bash
anolisa adapter enable tokenless <framework>
```

CLI-only use does not require an adapter.

### “Compression off” affects only compression operations

With `compression_enabled=false` or `TOKENLESS_COMPRESSION_ENABLED=0`, `compress`,
`compress-schema`, `compress-response`, and `compress-toon` still calculate predicted savings and
may write statistics, but return the original input. They do not write Stash entries in this mode.

This setting does not disable RTK command rewriting, adapter execution, or retrieval. Tool Ready is independently hard-disabled. To stop all Tokenless behavior in an agent, disable the adapter:

```bash
anolisa adapter disable tokenless <framework>
```

### Reversible compression is conditional

Active response/schema truncation and build/log gap removal stash the removed payload in
`~/.tokenless/stash.db` by default and add a marker such as:

```text
<<tokenless:0123456789abcdef01234567>>
```

The payload can be recovered through `tokenless retrieve` or the MCP `tokenless_retrieve` tool. Recovery is unavailable when:

- `--no-stash` was used.
- Compression was running in dry-run mode.
- The Stash database was unavailable or a write failed.
- The entry exceeded its TTL.
- The 10,000-live-entry capacity evicted an older entry.
- The caller uses a different Stash database path.

Stash does not make all compression reversible. Removed `debug`/`trace` fields, `null` and empty values, schema `title`/`examples`, and Markdown formatting are not stored for retrieval. Validate critical payloads with representative data before enabling active compression.

### Processing errors usually fail open

Compression and rewrite hooks normally return no modification when `tokenless` or `rtk` is missing,
compression provides no savings, or an ordinary processing error occurs. The `compress` command returns
the original in every non-`applied` response. Tool Ready is hard-disabled before its legacy check,
repair, and blocking logic. Post-tool failure attribution is independent and remains unchanged.

Command rewriting also changes the shell command submitted by the host. Most adapters replace the command input directly; Hermes blocks the first call and tells the agent to retry with the rewritten command. Validate important command workflows as well as compressed output.

## Supported Agent adapters

| OpenClaw | Plugin | Hard-disabled Tool Ready, `exec` rewrite, persisted-result replacement, optional TOON; no Schema |
| Hermes | Plugin | Hard-disabled Tool Ready, block-and-retry rewrite, result replacement with response + TOON; no Schema |
| Qoder | Plugin | Hard-disabled Tool Ready, rewrite, response pipeline through `updatedToolOutput`; no Schema |
| Claude Code | Marketplace plugin | Hard-disabled Tool Ready, Bash rewrite, response replacement on Claude Code 2.1.121 or later; conditional TOON; no Schema |
| Codex | Plugin | Hard-disabled Tool Ready, RTK rewrite, environment-failure diagnostics; no response/TOON replacement or Schema |
| OpenCode | Plugin | Hard-disabled Tool Ready, Bash rewrite, tool-output replacement with response + TOON, Schema |
| Qwen Code | Extension | Hard-disabled Tool Ready, rewrite; current host lacks post-tool replacement and skips the declared BeforeModel event |

## Supported Agent development frameworks

## Recommended rollout

1. Complete the [Quick Start](QUICKSTART.md) with non-sensitive test data.
2. Record a dry-run baseline for the same task.
3. Enable active compression and compare both output quality and savings.
4. Confirm that local-data and SLS behavior meets your requirements.
5. Enable the adapter for production agents.

The `tokenless --help` output from the installed version is the final authority for CLI and configuration behavior.
